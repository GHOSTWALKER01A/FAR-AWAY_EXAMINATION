# Exami Frontend — Next.js Blueprint
### "Every dashboard, every page, every feature, wired to a real API endpoint"

> A complete, build-ready frontend plan. Each page lists its features and the exact backend
> endpoints it calls. Nothing is hand-wavy — if a page shows data, the API that feeds it is named.

---

## PART 0 — TECH STACK & GROUND RULES

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Framework | **Next.js 14 (App Router)** | Server Components for fast loads, Route Handlers for BFF proxying |
| Language | **TypeScript** | Type-safe API contracts shared with the backend |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui** | Fast, consistent, accessible components |
| Data fetching | **TanStack Query (React Query)** | Caching, retries, optimistic updates, polling |
| Forms | **React Hook Form + Zod** | Same Zod schemas as backend = no validation drift |
| Real-time | **socket.io-client** | Proctoring WebSocket |
| State | **Zustand** | Lightweight session/exam state (timer, current question) |
| Charts | **Recharts** | Scoreboards, score distributions, risk timelines |
| Auth | **JWT in memory + refresh cookie** | Access token in memory, refresh via HttpOnly cookie |
| PDF | **react-pdf / @react-pdf/renderer** | Result report downloads |

### The 4 Apps (route groups)

Next.js App Router lets us split by **route groups**. We have 4 logical apps under one Next.js project:

```
app/
├── (auth)/            → Login, OTP        [public]
├── (admin)/           → Admin + Examiner + Invigilator dashboards   [staff]
├── (exam)/            → Student exam portal   [candidate]
└── (public)/          → Public registration, public scoreboard   [no auth]
```

### Universal rules every page follows
1. **API base:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = http://localhost:3000/api/v1`
2. **Auth header:** Axios interceptor injects `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`; on 401 → silent `POST /auth/refresh` → retry once → else redirect to login.
3. **Response shape:** Every call unwraps `{ success, data }` → `data`. Errors throw `{ code, message }`.
4. **Loading/empty/error:** Every data page has 3 states — skeleton loader, empty state, error toast.
5. **RBAC in UI:** The decoded JWT role hides/shows nav items and buttons (the backend still enforces — UI is just UX).

Route group: `app/(admin)/monitor/`
Real-time, WebSocket-driven. The most "live" surface in the app.

### D1 — `/monitor` — My Live Exams
**Features:**
- List of exams currently LIVE that this invigilator is assigned to
- Each card: exam title, # active candidates, # HIGH-risk, enter button

---

### D2 — `/monitor/:examId` — Live Proctoring Wall
**Features:**
- Grid of candidate cards: name, risk badge (green/yellow/red), last event, mini event timeline
- **Sorted by risk descending** (highest risk floats to top, auto-reorders in real time)
- Click a card → detail drawer: full event timeline, webcam snapshot frames, risk breakdown
- Per-candidate actions: Flag (with note), Extend Time, Send Message
- Connection-health indicator (WS connected / fallback to REST polling)

**APIs used:**
| Action | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|
| Initial load | `GET /proctor/live?examId=:id` |
| Real-time updates | `WS /ws/proctor` → listen `proctor:update` |
| Send candidate message | `WS /ws/proctor` → emit `invig:message` |
| REST fallback for events | `POST /sessions/:id/events` |
| Flag | `POST /sessions/:id/flag` |
| Extend time | `POST /sessions/:id/extend-time` |

**Real-time pattern:** load initial state via REST, then subscribe via WebSocket. Each `proctor:update` patches the matching candidate card and re-sorts. If WS drops → fall back to polling `GET /proctor/live` every 5s and show a "reconnecting" banner.

---

## DASHBOARD E — STUDENT PORTAL (8 pages)

Route group: `app/(exam)/`
Two visual modes: **normal portal** (browse/register/results) and **locked exam mode** (fullscreen, proctored, minimal chrome).

### E1 — `/exams` — My Exams
**Features:**
- Three sections: Upcoming, Available to register, Completed
- Each card: title, date/time, mode, status, action button (Register / Enter / View Result)

**APIs used:**
| Action | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|
| Available/enrolled exams | `GET /exams?status=LIVE` + `GET /exams?status=SCHEDULED` |
| Restore identity | `GET /auth/me` |

---

### E2 — `/exams/:id/register` — Self Registration
**Features:**
- Exam info, "X seats remaining" live counter
- Form: name, email (prefilled), phone
- Waitlist messaging when full

**APIs used:**
| Action | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|
| Register | `POST /exams/:examId/register` |

**Result:** ENROLLED → confirmation w/ slot; WAITLISTED → "we'll email you."

---

### E3 — `/exams/:id/check` — System Check (precheck gate)
**Features:**
- Live checklist: camera (with preview thumbnail), mic, network speed, browser compatibility, fullscreen
- Each item shows pass/fail; "Start Exam" disabled until all pass
- Requests camera/mic permissions, runs a quick network test

**APIs used:**
| Action | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|
| Submit readiness | `POST /sessions/:examId/precheck` |

**Result:** if `examLive` and all gates pass → unlock "Start Exam".

---

### E4 — `/exam/:examId` — The Exam Runner (the core experience)
This is **locked exam mode** — fullscreen, no nav, tab-switch detection active.

**Features:**
- **Top bar:** server-synced countdown timer, question progress (Q 5 of 40 / or "Adaptive"), connection dot
- **Question panel:** stem, options/answer input by type, marks indicator
- **Navigation:** Next / Submit Answer; (Previous only for FIXED/RANDOMISED — hidden in ADAPTIVE)
- **Auto-save** each answer to localStorage before POST; "Saving… / Saved ✓ / Retrying…" status
- **Proctoring (invisible):** background listeners emit tab-switch, blur, fullscreen-exit, face events over WS
- **Heartbeat:** every 10–15s, syncs remaining time, detects second-device takeover
- **Submit:** confirmation modal with answered count → thank-you screen

**APIs used:**
| Action | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|
| Start session | `POST /sessions/:examId/start` |
| Get next question | `GET /sessions/:id/next-item` |
| Submit answer | `POST /sessions/:id/answer` |
| Keep-alive + timer | `POST /sessions/:id/heartbeat` |
| Submit exam | `POST /sessions/:id/submit` |
| Emit proctoring events | `WS /ws/proctor` → emit `proctor:events` |
| Event fallback | `POST /sessions/:id/events` |

**Critical patterns:**
- Timer driven by `remainingSeconds` from start/heartbeat — never the client clock.
- `clientNonce` generated per question; retries reuse the same nonce (idempotent, no double-score).
- ADAPTIVE: no back button; show upfront "you can't review previous questions."
- `next-item` returning `{ done: true }` → auto-prompt submit.

---

### E5 — `/exam/:examId/resume` — Resume After Disconnect
**Features:**
- Detected on portal load if an active session exists
- Shows remaining time + answered count, single "Resume Exam" button
- Re-acquires the session lock on this device

## PART 4 — KEY REUSABLE COMPONENTS

| Component | Used by | What it does |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| `ExamTimer` | E4, E5 | Counts down from server `remainingSeconds`, re-syncs on each heartbeat, warns < 60s |
| `QuestionRenderer` | E4 | Renders any question type from `next-item`; never receives the answer key |
| `AnswerInput` | E4 | Type-aware input (radio, checkbox, textarea, numeric, code) → builds the `answer` payload |
| `RubricBuilder` | C6 | Criterion + max-marks editor for subjective questions |
| `OptionEditor` | C6 | MCQ option list with correct-answer marking |
| `ImportPreview` | C7 | Green/red row table from `bulk/preview` response |
| `DraftCard` | C8 | Editable AI-generated question card with Save/Discard |
| `CandidateCard` | D2 | Live risk badge + event timeline, patched by WS updates |
| `RiskBadge` | D2, B4 | LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH colored pill from risk bucket |
| `EventTimeline` | D2 | Chronological proctoring events with severity/confidence |
| `ScoreboardTable` | C10, E7, F2 | Ranked results with own-row highlight |
| `ConfidenceBar` | C9 | Visual AI-confidence indicator in the grading queue |
| `GradePanel` | C9 | Split answer/rubric override editor with live total |

## PART 5 — CRITICAL FRONTEND PATTERNS (must-implement)

1. **Server-authoritative timer.** The exam clock is `remainingSeconds` from the backend (start + every heartbeat). Never compute deadlines on the client — clock drift and tab-throttling will cheat or cheat the student.

2. **Idempotent answer submission.** Generate one `clientNonce` per question. On network failure, retry the POST with the **same** nonce. The backend dedupes — zero risk of double-scoring.

3. **Offline-first answers.** Write each answer to `localStorage` *before* the POST. Show "Saving… / Saved ✓ / Retrying…". On reconnect, flush any unsent answers.

4. **WebSocket with REST fallback (both sides).** Student emits proctoring events over WS; if WS is down, queue and batch via `POST /sessions/:id/events`. Invigilator subscribes via WS; if down, poll `GET /proctor/live` every 5s.

5. **Resume on reload.** On portal/exam-route load, check for an active session and offer Resume via `POST /sessions/:examId/resume` — never restart the timer from full.

6. **Adaptive UX guardrails.** In ADAPTIVE mode: no Previous button, upfront warning, auto-submit when `next-item` returns `{ done: true }`.

7. **RBAC-aware UI.** `middleware.ts` redirects wrong-role users away from route groups; decoded JWT hides buttons. Backend is the real gate — UI just avoids dead-ends.

8. **Optimistic + invalidate.** Grading approve/override and grievance resolve use optimistic updates, then `queryClient.invalidateQueries` to reconcile with the server (scoreboard auto-re-ranks on upheld grievance).

9. **Single source of response shape.** One axios interceptor unwraps `{ success, data }` and throws `{ code, message }` — every hook gets clean data or a typed error.

10. **Fullscreen lock + tamper signals.** The exam runner requests fullscreen; exiting fullscreen, tab blur, copy/paste, and devtools-open all emit proctoring events (warn, never auto-fail).

## PART 6 — BUILD ORDER (suggested sprint plan)

| Sprint | Deliverable | Pages |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Auth + API client + layouts | A1, A2, shells |
| 2 | Exam authoring | C2, C3, C5, C6 |
| 3 | Question tooling | C7, C8, C4 |
| 4 | Student exam runner (the crown jewel) | E3, E4, E5, E6 |
| 5 | Proctoring live wall | D1, D2 |
| 6 | Grading + results + grievances | C9, C10, C11, E7, E8 |
| 7 | Admin overview + public pages + polish | B1–B6, F1, F2 |
